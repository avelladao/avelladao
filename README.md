## 🇺🇸 Hello there 👋

<p align="center"><b>Electrical & Computer Engineering • UAS / Sensing / Signal Processing • Defense/Aerospace </b></p>

<p align="center">
I am currently a junior at Southern Methodist University, building hardware-backed engineering projects that translate to defense-grade thinking: reliability, constraints, test plans, and clear documentation.
My goal is to lead electrical engineering in UAS product development—designing and validating drone subsystems and sensing payloads.

## Previous Initiatives
**NSF SCALE REU (Summer 2025) — UAS Systems + Telemetry Concepts + 3D Reconstruction**
- Pixhawk/QGroundControl operations + structured field workflow
- Telemetry + environmental path loss exploration (reliability thinking)
- Perception experiments with inference-time focus (VisDrone/YOLO, AIDER anomaly detection)
- Digital twin pipeline: COLMAP → Gaussian Splatting (3D reconstructions)
---
## Current Projects (Spring 2026)
**Physical Low-Light Imaging Device 
**Handheld/wearable low-light camera system that improves visibility using:
- gain control + amplification (observe noise growth)
- filtering trade-offs (noise vs detail)
- dynamic range/contrast enhancement
Evaluation across settings with documented results (visibility vs noise vs latency).
*(Learning-focused; not image-intensifier hardware.)*
