## Hello there 👋

<p align="center">
I am currently a junior at Southern Methodist University, building hardware-backed engineering projects that translate to defense-grade thinking: reliability, constraints, test plans, and clear documentation.
My goal is to become a chief electrical engineer, leading UAS product development: designing and validating drone subsystems and sensing payloads. I’m also developing a strong interest in semiconductor devices & fabrication, including hands-on exposure to cleanroom processes, microfabrication workflows, and device-level engineering.

## Previous Initiatives
**NSF SCALE REU (Summer 2025) — UAS Systems + Telemetry Concepts + 3D Reconstruction**
- Pixhawk/QGroundControl operations + structured field workflow
- Perception experiments with inference-time focus (VisDrone/YOLO, AIDER anomaly detection)
- Telemetry + environmental path loss exploration (reliability thinking)
- Digital twin pipeline: COLMAP → Gaussian Splatting (3D reconstructions)
---
**P-channel MOSFET Transistor Fabrication (Semiconductor Devices Cleanroom Project)**
- Built and inspected a p-channel MOSFET transistor through a multi-step cleanroom fabrication workflow in Semiconductor Devices.
- Performed photolithography, oxidation, ion implantation, metallization, and etching.
- Handled silicon wafers and conducted microscope inspection during process checkpoints.
- Developed hands-on understanding of device fabrication flow, source/drain formation, and process-driven device behavior.

## Current Projects (Spring 2026)
#### Physical Low-Light Imaging Device  
- Handheld/wearable low-light camera system that improves visibility using:
- gain control + amplification (observe noise growth)
- filtering trade-offs (noise vs detail)
- dynamic range/contrast enhancement
- Evaluation across settings with documented results (visibility vs noise vs latency)

#### MOSFET Differential Amplifier (Circuits II — Hardware Build)
- Designing, fabricating, and validating a MOSFET differential amplifier
- Using a **Nova Voltera** to print the circuit on a **flexible substrate**
- Testing gain, bias stability, and noise behavior with measured results & revisions
